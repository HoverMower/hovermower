Special thanks to Josh Newans for his blog and videos about ros2 robot, which highly inspired me in how to organize my packages. His content is pretty clear, understandable and he did great effort creating well structured and compact instructions. Reach out [Articulated Robotics](https://articulatedrobotics.xyz/) and watch the videos.
